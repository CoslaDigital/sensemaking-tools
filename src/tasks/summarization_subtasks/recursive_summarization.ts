/**
 * Resolves Promises sequentially, optionally using batching for limited parallelization.

 * @param promises the promises to resolve.
 * @param numParallelExecutions how many promises to resolve at once, the default is 2 based on the
 * current Gemini qps quotas, see: https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/quotas#per-second.
