1297,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me means being able to express yourself without being targeted for your ideas, thoughts or actions. For example when saying something that others may agree with or not agree with, that what you said is protected, and no worry of repercussions. They are your thoughts, your ideas. We shouldn't become targets because others don't agree with it. If anything it should open up a conversation as to why you feel that way.  Under the current political climate, they are taking that away from us, by name calling, labeling, saying its a weakness, and being a crybaby. When isn't that what they are just doing themselves? 
Practicing this I have seen lately gets people taken away, scrutinized, threatened, and jailed.  It should not be like this at all. People have forgotten how to listen to each other to get a better understanding of why someone feels the way they do. 
My only experience in this is with friends that are on the opposite end of the political spectrum.  I remind them that I am not on neither side, pretty much in the middle, and that we can't just have it their way or the highway attitude. I ask them to tell me why they feel the way they do, and I ask the same respect when speaking my mind about whatever the subject is.  And I always thank them for listening to me, even if they don't agree. We at least heard each other out.
They do appreciate that. 
</response>

<question>When has expressing your thoughts, even when different, led to a deeper understanding or a stronger connection with someone?</question>
<response>When we saw we had shared events and experiences.  
I gave them an example of what I agreed with that I understood where they were coming from. My grandmother, an immigrant from Mexico, and a naturalized citizen of the US for over 40 years, would hand me stacks of letters coming from Medicare. They were thick and would ask me to read them to her and what were they. They were itemized bills showing what was being paid for by Medicare, this was back in the 90's.  When I told my grandmother this, she didn't understand, as long as they were not asking her to pay for something.  I went thru quite a few of those stacks, and started comparing the dates with the charges, and found things that they were being charged for that my grandmother didn't have done, or for medical equipment she didn't possess, like a cane, walker, etc.  I called Medicare to report this fraud to them and asking them to take action against whomever was billing in error from the Dr office, hospital, medical facility that it was coming from.  A Medicare representative told me that they really didn't look into this and would let us know if something became of it. Crickets...nothing ever happened.  
While in the meantime, I am hearing on the news how there might not be Medicare or Social Security available to those of us in the future, and the rampant fraud going on at that time. I was appalled, because I always thought each of the departments of the government handling our tax dollars always double checked things, scrutinized things before paying out. I was wrong. 
Coming back to today, I do feel that there needs to be balances and checks for each department of the government.  I do get why those that decry fraud or foul, is due to what we have all thought all along  isn't happening. So, we are now in a government that is forcing changes without really making  sure they are needed or the right changes within those departments. 
That is an example of how it led to a deeper understanding with someone. </response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means, you as a person are equal to any other person on this planet.  Not just the United States.  
I am a woman, and it took until I was in my 30's before I really got the chance to see for myself how unequal things had been between men and women. Between different races, between different cultures, between different countries. 
The differences between men and women are physical only, but the mind and the spirit are the same. Equality amongst men and women needs to be understood as a mutual respect between them, meaning we both bring something to the table. Women have weaknesses and strengths, and so do men. 
A story that put into perspective why I feel this way is one where a Woman was being celebrated for the the first Woman to run in the Boston Marathon in the 70's, and a picture someone took of that woman being pushed out by some angry man along the route because He didn't want to see a Woman in that race.  It reminded me how long it has taken for Women to be taken seriously as equal to men. 
What does this have to do with what equality means to me, well we have to start at being equal somewhere. </response>

<question>Thinking about the marathon story, what might it take for everyone to understand that both men and women bring important things to the table, and to truly respect those differences?</question>
<response>Listening to each other and seeing men are just as vulnerable as women.</response>

265,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom, to me, means being able to choose what you want to do and how you want to live without fear of repercussions. Freedom does not mean you get to treat others poorly though. There are certain limitations that should be kept on freedom due to the negative qualities of human nature.  I spent my fundamental developmental years in homeless shelters with my mom. I've seen the dark side to humans, which is what led me to this understanding on what freedom means and should mean. </response>

<question>How do your experiences in homeless shelters show you the ""dark side to humans"" and how does that connect to your idea of freedom needing limits?</question>
<response>To be perfectly honest, I don't remember anything from it. I don't remember much of anything from my past due to my brain blocking out memories. I know what my mom has told me. She was also in abusive relationships which I do remember snippets of. I remember seeing the dark side to humans in that. Being manipulation, physical and psychological abuse, etc. It's hard to see others being treated so poorly from someone without the perpetrator being punished or held accountable. This is something we see everyday in society. People feel as though they are allowed to say anything they want to someone else, no matter how vile it may be. And on a certain level they're right in thinking they can. Our court system still doesn't really recognize the impact words can have on a person. I think we're slowly moving towards the right direction in not letting people get away with it so much. But we still have a long way to go. Words can be damaging and cause enough impact to push someone over the edge. That's where I think freedom needs limitations.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality, to me, means a society where opportunities and life is as fairly made as possible. Experiences in life that led me to this understanding, is simply growing up and noticing life around me. Striving for equality is extremely important, but should also be understood that it is a difficult thing to appropriately achieve. </response>

<question>What does ""fairly made as possible"" look like in a real-world community, and what are some of the hardest parts about making that happen?</question>
<response>So one of the biggest issues when it comes to equality, in my opinion, is the difference between men and woman. Both genders have different strengths, weaknesses, and needs. Reproductive rights are different from one another, and are treated differently from one another, but not always in the best way. I'm not sure what ""fairly made as possible"" would look like. Take abortion for example. I believe a woman has the right to choose whether or not she wants to have a baby. If a woman chooses to keep the baby, but the man did not want the baby, she can take him to court for child support. That doesn't sound fair, right? Maybe the man should have the right to abort his parental rights within the same time frame that a woman is allowed to have an abortion? Would that make things a little more equal? I'm, honestly, not sure. Then there's the women who chose to have an abortion when the man wanted to have the baby. There's not really a way to make that situation fair or equal. I know this is a touchy subject, but I look at matters in depth. Abortion is an area that has a lot of gray, and is one of the trickiest areas to try and find equal rights in. </response>

<response>These are all wonderful ideals on the surface. For example, ""All men and women are created equal"" is fundamentally great thinking. Reminding people that no one is above another. But in reality, America is an extremely diverse place. There are people who are born with nothing, while others  are born with a silver spoon in the mouth. All men and women are created equal, but all men and women do not start life equally. </response>

<question>When thinking about people starting life differently, what steps might help our nation move closer to the idea that everyone is truly equal?</question>
<response>Maybe we could have better government programs to help equal the playing field. Take for instances our government disability program. It can take years for someone to finally get on disability that they are rightfully entitled to. Because our government made it such a difficult process. They always deny your first application. Always.

Me being a mother I have to juggle so much and get to experience being around so many people in my community and this has made me aware of the unjust going on and how too many Americans are self centered.

1504,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom as a citizen of the United States primarily refers to freedom from government oppression and freedom of opportunity. As a member of American society, people are generally free to believe what they want and to express their opinions and beliefs without suppression or retribution from the government or fellow citizens (with reasonable limits, such as slander, language specifically intended to create situations that endanger others, actions that directly interfere with the rights of private citizens to carry out normal daily activities, etc.).  American citizens are also free to aspire to acheive their financial and vocational dreams, regardless of their socioeconomic, ethnic, or political background, as long as they have the abilities and talent required to perform and put in the time and effort needed to earn their place.

In school, I learned that the United States grew largely from groups of people whose ideas, goals, and actions defied the practices and cultures of their government or society, and made the dangerous trip across the ocean (sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not) in search of opportunity. With the birth and early growth of the United States came more people in search of a society where they were free to try to achieve the life they desired without fear. At the same time, others were brought here against their will and forced into generational servitude and an absolute lack of freedom, the effects of which still ripple through American society today. So through my education I learned that freedom is valuable enough to risk your life to achieve, and precious enough that it's loss is absolutely devastating.

Growing up, I watched both of my parents work hard to provide for our family, and both took risks to do so. My mother, a nurse, left a stable job at a hospital to join two physicians who were starting a private practice. They had no guarantee of success, and financial stability was far from immediate. Over time, they did succeed, and my mother spent the bulk of her career working with them, building her own finances and security. My father, an accountant, was working at a small firm when his employer suffered a severe medical emergency that threatened the closure of the company. He worked hard to keep the company going, and ultimately worked out a deal to purchase the company over time when his employer decided to officially retire. My father built that small firm to one of the largest in the area, and eventually developed a financial footing I'm sure would have been nearly unimaginable when he and my mother first married.  In their jobs, both of my parents worked with a wide spectrum of patients/clients, from the privileged to the penniless, and treated them all with the same level of respect... as equals. This is what it means in the United States when we speak of equality. It doesn't mean that we are all the same--it means that we have the same opportunity to achieve goals and are (or should be) treated thusly. </response>

<question>Considering the importance of freedom in American society, how might the experiences of those brought to the United States against their will, and their descendants, shape their understanding of freedom today?</question>
<response>Those brought to the United States against their will faced deplorable conditions and treatment for generations both when slavery was legal and in the century that followed. Anyone looking back objectively at that situation today would view it as a horrifying depiction of what life without freedom can mean. It is an evil that lurks at our doorstep, constantly trying to get in through attempts to limit what people can read, or say, or do in their personal lives. Slavery officially ended about 160 years ago, but former slaves and their descendants continued to legally face oppression for another century until the passage of Civil Rights Acts in the 1960s. Although these laws placed barriers on discrimination through legislation, societial discrimination continues in pockets throughout the country (some larger and more deeply-ingrained than others). These feelings directly and indirectly impact freedom today through mutual suspicion, subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) mistreatment of one another, and a sense of danger that chips away the relative tranquility those living in a free country should feel.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality is an essential aspect of a free society. If freedom means freedom of opportunity, it follows that people must be treated equally in order to enjoy such opportunity. It is a common misconception that equality means everyone should be the same. We're not all the same. We all have unique skills, talents, and strengths, as well as weaknesses and faults. We also come from different backgrounds and have different life experiences. What equality means is that despite where you come from, what you look like, or what you believe, you will not be shut out from the opportunity to achieve your personal goals if you have the personal ability to do so.

I've met and worked with people from a variety of different backgrounds who have achieved vocational success in fields that might have been closed off to them a century ago due to the color of the skin, their religious beliefs, or other factors. Their hard work and perseverance helped them achieve their goals, and in doing so, they have benefitted me and others with their knowledge, skills, and talents as coworkers, advisors, skilled craftspeople, or providers of professional services. </response>

<question>It is interesting to hear how people can achieve their goals when given a fair chance. What might be some ways we can help make sure everyone has that same opportunity, even if they face big challenges?</question>
<response>The most direct way to ensure that people are given a fair chance to achieve their goals is to level the playing field as much as possible without giving any segment of the population an unfair advantage over another. This would include enforcing existing laws that prohibit discrimination in hiring, housing, education, and so on, as well as fostering an environment in which those in charge of deciding whether to hire a job candidate, rent an apartment, issue a loan, admit to an educatioal institution, etc. are encouraged to be objective and focus solely on relevant factors. 

For people facing big challenges in achieving their goals, there's no easy answer. If their challenge is a financial one, offering loans and grants may be an option. If their challenge involves issues such as child care or caring for infirm family members, options might include subsidized child care or in-home aides. If their challenge is a physical limitation that can be overcome with a reasonable accommodation, the accommodation should be made if it is feasible to do so. </response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>These are simple guidelines that should be an inherent part of the way Americans live their lives, and should come as naturally as saying ""thank you"" when someone assists you in even a small way. In regard to drafting legislation or creating institutional rules or regulations, these basic ideals should be a general baseline of what is considered acceptable. In other words, when creating a rule, if it violates these general principles, rewrite the rule or scrap it altogether. </response>

<question>When rules or laws are made, how might we help make sure they truly follow these important ideas you shared?</question>
<response>To make sure well-developed rules and regulations are followed, those in charge of executing and enforcing these rules need to put into place people who understand the importance, value, and general meaning of equality. This includes hiring (or electing) individuals who will honor these values, and either counseling or removing those already in these positions who don't. </response>","Freedom... refers to freedom from government oppression and freedom of opportunity...

That as long as no harm is being done to me, others, and or property that it is acceptable. That I also must give others the chance to speak their truths and beliefs even if different than mine.

When I was a senior in High School I was able to take a school trip to Washington DC midst the Watergate scandal... we were able to talk about, discuss our views.

<response>Things in our social situations are wound too tightly now - you have no way on how people are going to react.  I think that the isolation that came out of Covid started people down a path of self indilgence -- it is all about me and what I need now and only for me. The panic caused people to hoard and shelter and forget that people were in things together not alone.  Then we moved into a political divide that started down a violate road. That shooting people was the way to handle things. If there is a problem, just kill it and it goes away. But that only stirs the pot of more unrest.

<response>Equality to mean is the same reward for the same experience. My gender, my belief, my nationality, my language should not be used to single out and push someone above someone else. Unfortunately, we have been doing that for so long, I am not sure how we get this going in the right direction. I know of others that feel we should not have programs that have things in place to help those in soc-economic systems less than ours. I had to work for mine why should they just get things, But you have to look at the whole picture --- years, decades, centuries we stomped on theirs ancestries and left them in situations with no way out -- we grew on their backs. So opening the opportunites for some is a way to move the world forward and back together. Yes, there will be people to scam the systems - find the way to kick them out/off .</response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>I believe we need to get BACK to these principals/ideals. I  believe if you asked people on the street not many could tell you where these came from. That these were the principals that this country was build and fought for all over the world. 

People need to believe and practice these things in their own personal lives so then collectively we can do it as a country. If you cant be kind to yourself - how can you to others?</response>

<question>What makes it hard for people to remember or live by these important ideas today, and what might help us all practice them more in our daily lives?</question>
<response>People are struggling and feeling like they are getting no where. They dont feel safe for themselves, their families, children, friends. Its almost like people are growing cocoons around their group to protect them, keep them safe.  I grew up in the 60s and 70s in a midwest suburb and I knew that every one of those houses on the two blocks that surrounded ours were a safe place for me if any thing went wrong or if I felt I needed help.  I now live in a 125 apartment building and I am not sure I could knock on any door for help. How did we lose that daily trust in 55 years?

Maybe I should start with a few of the apartments on my floor and exchange numbers as a start to recapture it.</response>",I believe we need to get back to these principles/ideals.

3047,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom is both implied and real-world life actions.  Implied freedom includes rights established by our founding fathers in the Constitution or in a community or familial situation.  The right to be safe, allowed to make sound decisions, and the ability to work as hard (or not) if you so choose.  Real-world actions are choices individuals make, similar to having the choice to join an organization, buy a gun, or eat at McDonald's. I lived in an oriental household where rules were strict and you had to take into account the overall welfare of the household, your family and the school, and the town community.</response>

<question>Considering your experience in a strict household, how might those early lessons about collective well-being shape your understanding of individual choices and freedoms today?</question>
<response>It made me understand that one's overall attitude and contributions affect more than myself.  A decision could impact others directly, which can leave either a positive or a negative outcome. It made me appreciate the ability to make decisions when I was able to go out on my own. Often, they were not the best ones to make, but I learned and kept those lessons in my mind so they would not be repeated.  We are blessed to live in a place where we can make decisions, where one does not have to completely conform to another person or government. We don't haveto have  total agreement to function or make a contribution.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality is the idea that every person can achieve success through the same distribution of wealth, access, and opportunity. Although it is not how real life works under this current administration,  the disparity of income, color, and gender too often creates gaps. We are seeing the poor judgment and retaliation of people create less equity in this country. It is of deep concern that there is less and less equity in our country. Experiences include going to school, living in a small rural community, and working in environments that were both healthy and oppressive.</response>

<question>You mentioned that ""poor judgment and retaliation of people create less equity."" Could you share a time when you saw this happen, and what made you feel it was unfair?</question>
<response>ICE is a perfect example. Yes, there are people who have entered this country illegally. We do not need to treat another human being as ""less than"", nor give them the basic right to prove their innocence or a phone call. The color of someone's skin should not determine whether they are detained or not.  Way too many assumptions of guilt. It is breaking up families and local communities. We should not condemn people for wanting a better way of life. free of oppression.  Isn't that what our forefathers did in 1776? </response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>It should be a driving force. not used against people based on 1 person's evil intentions and retaliation for their own faults. Greed and ego do too much damage. The distribution of money can be fixed if a certain elected official would make the right decision for ALL, just not themselves and their friends and family. These ideals should serve as a guide and inspiration, not a tool to harm others or disrupt their way of life. As my father used to say, ""Put yourself in the other person's shoes"".</response>

<question>How might these ideals, as a driving force, help address the challenges of greed and ego when leaders make decisions for everyone, not just a select few?</question>
<response>The general public needs to continue to make our elected officials, corporate board, and officers accountable.  Use your right to vote, keep being the eyes and ears for others, civil disobedience may be necessary, take the time to reach and help others, even if it is a scary step. Our voices need to continue to be heard.  Pressure must be exerted to try to hold a line against greed. So much energy needs to be spent on the ""power"" of 1.

<response>Freedom means being able to do what you want as long as it does not have a significant material affect/impact on others.  It mean being given the latitude to make your own decisions and mistakes, assuming it causes no physical, financial, or (significant) emotional/mental harm to others.  </response>

<question>When thinking about freedom, what makes it so important for people to be able to make their own choices, even if those choices lead to mistakes?</question>
<response>You learn from mistakes and taking risks.  That doesn't mean every choice you make needs to be risky, but allowing for that learning is a form of freedom.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality to me means being treated the same as everyone else, regardless of your background.  I was raised in a Jewish family (not practicing anymore) and I have a daughter with disabilities, so I have seen discrimination first-hand.  And discrimination is anti-equality... </response>

<question>How might being treated the same, when people have different needs or abilities, connect with your experiences of discrimination?</question>

1725,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom, in the context of being an American, is the ability to become anything you want to become as long as you put in the work. There should be nothing that prevents a person to legally do what it takes to achieve what they have determined as their goal, whether it be education or a job, home ownership etc.
I also believe this freedom is the right of all Americans, no matter race, creed or color.
My experience in life was that I was taught to work hard to achieve my goals. I tested to become a firefighter and was able to score well enough to eventually get hired. I put in the work and was rewarded because of it. 
Freedom is also the ability to speak my mind and make choices without pressure from outside sources.
  </response>

<question>How might your idea of freedom, as the ability to become anything through hard work, connect with situations where people face big challenges they can't control, like things outside their job or school?</question>
<response>I'm not sure what challenges people might face that they can't control, except physical or medical challenges or possibly racial discrimination.
I have seen people overcome physical and medical challenges by taking them head on, working with experts, doctors, and figuring out a way to succeed despite their challenges. 
I can't speak about those whose race is part of the challenge they face but will admit that I have seen racial discrimination since I can remember. 
Congress and the courts have tried to fix those issues, but it has been a very long struggle, and I fear will continue to be.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>I think equality means that we as Americans should be treated the same by every other American.
I think that's the ideal, but I don't believe it's always true in many circumstances, alluding back to racial discrimination. As I've stated before, I've witnessed it my entire life, even as a young child in the '60's. I began to understand it more as I grew older and I think it's worse now. </response>

<question>When you say things are worse now, what makes you feel that way?</question>
<response>The internet, specifically social media, has given a new platform for people to discriminate, spew hate and misinformation and all behind the vail of a screen. The hate is instantly distributed and amplified by likeminded people. Foreign adversaries are responsible for much of the amplification and people don't seem to understand that. Our adversaries want to divide us.
When elected officials in our government are some of the worst, that's what make me feel this way.</response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>From a young age, people need to be taught, not just in school, but by their parents and other influential people that these values are what make us who we should be.
Schools are now, somehow, are in the middle of the battleground that has become a sad reflection on our society.
Parents who are affected by how they consume their news and get caught up in the misinformation the read are also to blame. Even some churches and religious groups are becoming affected by the same thing. It was never like that, as I recall, when I was growing up.
One more ideal that I would add to your list is the golden rule, do unto others... I feel that means little or nothing anymore.</response>

<question>Considering your thoughts on how these ideals shape us, what might be some ways to help parents, schools, and other groups teach the golden rule and other values in a world with so much different information?</question>
<response>Schools should ban the use of cell phones and get back to teaching kids the basics, not be afraid to uphold a level of discipline, and get the parents more involved, although I understand that's not always possible. The discipline I'm referring to is not physical to be sure, but there must be consequences for bad behavior.
Respect is another part of that equation, which should start at home. In my school days, teachers were respected as all adults were. </response>","My experience in life was that I was taught to work hard to achieve my goals. I tested to become a firefighter...

2510,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom is a gift. A gift that I was born with because I was born in this beautiful country. Freedom is the ability to make decisions for myself and to choose to live a moral, successful life that I love. Freedom, however, does not surpass law or boundaries. Freedom can be lost due to the consequences of one's poor, immoral choices. While we are free to make decisions, we must be law-abiding citizens who love and respect others.

Growing up as a Christian, I believe that freedom comes from God. I believe that America is a nation protected and blessed by Him, and that so long as we live in accordance with the laws of the land and the laws of God, He will continue to protect it. I know that many other countries are not as fortunate as we are in America to experience freedom of choice. Traveling to those countries has been eye-opening and a great reminder that I should not take the freedom I have for granted. I feel this especially as a woman, wife, and mother. </response>

<question>Considering your thoughts on freedom, what specific experiences or moments in your travels abroad highlighted the differences in freedom for you, especially as a woman?</question>
<response>Other countries do not grant women as many freedoms as America does. I am grateful to live in a country where I can choose what I wear, express my votes and opinions, and contribute to the betterment of society. I am grateful I can choose to be a mother and have as many children as my husband and I wish, according to God's will.  I can leave the house when I want to and know that for the most part, I and my children will be safe and respected.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means that we respect the constitutional rights and freedoms of all individuals with no exceptions for race, gender, ethnicity, disability, etc. All individuals have inherent and divine worth and deserve to be treated that way — regardless of whether they have differing opinions, behaviors, or political views. I believe that everyone is a child of God and that we have the responsibility to treat them that way.</response>

<question>How does the idea of respecting everyone's inherent worth, even with different opinions or behaviors, shape how you act in your daily life?</question>
<response>When I view everyone through this lens, I strive to conduct my life with kindness, respect, and understanding. It's not always easy to spend time with people with whom you disagree, but I believe that we should do our best to achieve mutual respect and understanding. That understanding comes from putting ourselves in each other's shoes, being patient, and striving to be a peacemaker. While complete agreement or understanding may not come, I do try to give others the benefit of the doubt and believe that all of us are trying our best to make the world a better place.</response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>I think more than ever, these ideals need to be at the forefront of our minds. I believe that if we keep these principles in our minds and hearts, we can free ourselves from the contention, cruelty, and evil that seems to be infecting our nation. We can foster a culture of peace, respect, and unity that must exist for America to be what she was meant to be.</response>

<question>What might it look like for these principles to be in our minds and hearts, helping to build a more peaceful and respectful nation?</question>
<response>We need to teach these principles in our homes! It starts with educating ourselves and then our children on the true character of our nation and what it was founded on. If American teachers and mentors don't believe in these ideals, I don't believe they should be the ones educating our children. I believe that peacemaking and respect really do begin in the home.

2779,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom is having the chance to create your own life, without fearing for your safety and ability to make a good living. I'm an immigrant and came to the United States at the age of 12 years old. M parents were the intrepid and ambitious souls who wanted to create a better life for their family in the United States, despite being working professionals in their home country. I was fortunate that they came to the United States to create a path for their family. I value their courage and sacrifice tremendously. I want to make them proud and by becoming an independent financial advisor in this country, I pave my own path to prosperity. In addition, I help people achieve financial freedom. </response>

<question>Considering your parents' brave journey, how might their definition of freedom have been similar to or different from your own today?</question>
<response>Their definition of freedom likely stems from a desire to provide a better financial life for their family. My definition actually resonates and aligns with that. Through my work, I learn as much as I can about financial investments so I can make proper recommendations to my clients in order for them to achieve their financial goals and financial prosperity. Likely the biggest difference though is that my parents are old-fashioned in that they expect their values and beliefs to be right all the time and that their children's beliefs, which are more Western as opposed to Eastern beliefs, are wrong. This is where we clash. I even tell that they raised us in Western culture, with Western values of freedom, and independent thought. Of course we will speak up and have differing opinions from theirs.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality to me is equality of opportunity. The American value is equality of opportunity, which is every person in this country, has the chance to make a better life for themselves. That is all any one can ask for...is the chance and the opportunity. It means not relying on any handouts or government assistance. It means not getting special treatment because of the color of your skin or where you came from. Inherently and biologically, men and women are not equal. We were created and designed differently and I think it's important as a society for us to understand these differences. Oftentimes, the media touts equality between genders but inherently there are inequalities between genders, between cultures, and ethnic groups. But we are all Americans and what we have is equality of opportunity. The experience that shaped this belief is that my parents raised me to rely on the government for subsidies and financial assistance. In fact, if you do, you become dependent on them and it limits your potential. Because humans who rely and depend on something or someone, become complacent and comfortable. And they don't feel the need to strive for something greater than their current conditions. I've been blessed to be educated in the United States and to also work abroad in my early working years, and this helped me become independent and resilient in dealing with challenges of living in another country.</response>

<question>Given your experience with government assistance, how might equality of opportunity look different for someone who faces challenges like disabilities or limited access to education?</question>
<response>I only took unemployment one time in my life, when I was fired from a job. And it was very short-term. I was determined to find another opportunity immediately because I did not want to create the mindset of always relying on someone. The United States is an abundant country with abundant resources and opportunities. There is more than enough for anyone who chooses to participate and strive to work to reap the benefits of being an American citizen or permanent resident. If you have a physical or mental disability, that is one thing. If your challenge is neither, I don't think it's enough of an excuse to rely on the government. I still think the United States gives opportunities to though who have disabilities and limited access to education. The opportunities are there but it is up to the person with the disability to take the opportunity to use it. But it's important to use it for striving and bettering ones self, not just to live off of it forever. </response>

<question>Many phrases have become part of our national heritage. These phrases typically identify ideals that we would like our nation to live up to. Please consider the following phrases:



All men and women are created equal.
We have been endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We should be judged by the content of our character, not by the color of our skin.
Our nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.



How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>1) Not all men and women are created equal, in a biological and physical sense. Men are created with stronger upper body strength than women. It's a biological fact. Everything else, though, yes, we are created equally in that we are all born with 4 limbs, and the same body parts and organs. Some are more predisposed to certain athletic abilities while some are more predisposed to certain ailments. It's simply genetics. So in a broad sense, yes men and women are created equal. But go into the nuances, and we are not. I think this particular phrase should be continued to be upheld in the school system and educate the future youth on some of the biological facts of life. I am not a supporter of transgender communities. 

2) We do have unalienable rights to pursue of life, liberty, and happiness. This isn't even an American value but a human value. Regardless of where you are in the world, you are entitled to live and make a living. I believe this phrase needs to continue to be taught as well to future generations.

3) I agree that character is more important than the color of your skin. There should not be favorable circumstances based on the color of your skin. It should be determined by aptitude and ability. 

4) Liberty is everything and again the notion of equality depends on whether you are talking about physically and biologically or something else. We are all equal in the sense that we have equal opportunity in this country. This value should also be upheld and passed down to the next generation.</response>

<question>Considering the idea of ""equal opportunity"" in our country, what might it mean for everyone to truly have the same chances, even with our different biological makeups or predispositions?</question>
<response>We all have the same chances in the sense that we all go through the same educational system in the beginning. Of course, when it comes to college and higher learning, that is where we are different because entrance into these colleges are based on ability, and are optional to attend. I still think America's educational system is one of the best, if not the best. We are a nation of innovators and creators. And Americans have a conscience to do good. I know this firsthand because I have lived in 2 other countries outside the United States, and the U.S. is still the best for economic opportunity and personal liberties. </response>","Freedom is having the chance to create your own life, without fearing for your safety and ability to make a good living.

2747,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me allows me (as United States citizen) the opportunity to not have my life predestined as chosen by a government entity.  I have the freedoms as stated in the U.S. Constitution which are transparent to most people as these are guaranteed as an American citizen including voting and openly criticizing government decisions openly without repercussions if I choose.   In addition to those freedoms  I have the opportunity to earn a living, to choose where I live, what type of job I have, what type of education to pursue after high school and what type of career I have.  I am also allowed to choose the size of my family.  There are many other aspects of my life that are much simpler that freedom allows me to have also.</response>

<question>Thinking about the freedoms you mentioned, what might it feel like if some of those choices, like where you live or your family size, were decided for you by others?</question>
<response>If the freedoms that I mentioned were decided by others, I might feel like it infringes upon my rights as a United States citizen.   However, I have been entitled to these rights for the 50 years that I have been alive.  If I were not born with these rights and had not been allowed to exercise them freely for the time I have been alive, I would feel as if I was losing freedom and that my rights were being infringed upon.  However, if I were born into a system where these freedoms had been decided by others my whole life, I would probably feel perfectly normal if these were decided by someone else unless I had had the opportunity to see other cultures and how they live.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>As humans we all have different starting points in life.  However, equality means that we are given the same rights to pursue life liberty and happiness.  Not all people start with the same resources so different people have different obstacles in life but still have the same access to opportunities.  Experiences in my life that have led me to this understanding include being diagnosed with hydrocephalus when I was 11 years and having a subdural hematoma that caused brain damage.  This affected my physical and academic abilities but with encouragement, persistence and hard work I was still able to achieve success in life, although my idea of success had changed after those events.</response>

<question>It is interesting how life's challenges can change what we see as success. Could you tell us more about how your idea of success changed after your brain injury?</question>
<response>I was a bright child with what looked like a very bright future in terms of academics and career.  However, I experienced many limitations due to my brain injury.  As a kid, I visited a neurologist who told my parents ""Be thankful he is alive"".  Although, the brain damage I experienced made sports and academic pursuits more challenging and even eliminated some opportunities, my parents were very supportive and encouraging which allowed me to develop new goals in life.  Even facing this challenge in my life, I still had the expectation of going to college. Success for me was being able to get accepted at a university, graduate, get a job, support myself, live independently and start a family.</response>

<response>Freedom is a concept and a construct,Freedom is a sense of collective values and cultural agreements on the definition of democracy and the agreed upon principals we act upon as a country.
On a personal level while I do not believe we actually have free will I do see freedom as the ability to make the majority of my own personal decisions. I can choose who I marry.where I go to school. Make my own medical decisions, where I work. Not all of this is actually free but it does promise me freedom as a democratic collective socie5y.</response>

<question>Considering your thoughts on collective values and personal decisions, what might it feel like if your ability to make those personal choices, like who you marry or where you work, were suddenly limited by those shared cultural agreements?</question>
<response>It would no longer be personal freedom. We have enough of those concepts tossed at us as women. Men get to d code women's personal health care decisions even deciding women should die because an abortion is not okay even if they safety of the mom is jeopardized?
Like wearing a Burka is not decided by women but men who get to decide the definition of modesty?
Our freedoms are being curtailed as I wrote. Police in major cities without a request, gerrymandering our states to steal votes. Using border patrol and national guard to raid cities without due process for the citizens detained. We are starting to feel like the third reich and the complacency in our country is frightening.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>I was born in the early 1940's following world war 2. I lived in Detroit. The big three auto producers with the help of the oAW.and Teamsters support actually provided a middle class living wage. But without violence and family suffering. Collective bargaining and emergency funds to support striking workers and their families became a model for union activity in the US.
In addition in my lifetime I was a child when John Kennedy was assignated , followed by Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. I experienced race riots in Detroit and Los Angeles. burning cities and businesses. I experienced the racial tension in a  city of immigrants and black citizens. I lived in Flint Michigan where much of the union and auto violence took place. I learned early on that the only way ordinary citizens would have a modicum of freedom would be to work collectively.
Our forefathers wrote a constitutionn and a bill of rights announcing every man would be considered equal  I have a feeling we are referring to landowners. Women were one of the last categories to get a vote. Again money talks and provides status. Our country is huge if we have to make our Intentions be known it could be very powerful. Unfortunately we seem to have allergies of uneducated and misled citizens zoned out by iPads and cheated by a dogma of an education.</response>

<question>Considering your experiences, how might the idea of ""every man being considered equal"" in our founding documents connect with or differ from the collective action you saw bring about change for working families?</question>
<response>Our country started out as the underdog fighting again an imperialist regime headed by a monarchy. We recognized the lack of freedom and religious inequality placed upon us. It is why we fought England, ""no taxation without representation"" and fought a war. In the eyes of the landownergentey they were protecting properties and luvlihoods. Equality was not for women white or black, many native Americans became slaves. I would like to romanticize our road to equality but it is not true. MartinLuther King responded when once was asked. Why pass laws. Let's change opinions first, stated. Pass the laws the law will be followed whether opinions change or not. The biggest change I have seen the responsibilities thrust upon single mothers to support their families and the inequalities between fathers and mothers in a divorce. Women still hold the bulk of responsibility for family.

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>These ideals are not outdated and still retain the idealism and love for the beliefs of our country. Unfortunately we now equate wealth and money with intellect and wisdom. I am a little cynical about the believing all women and men are created equal. It is simply not true. My own experiences I always worked two jobs to support my family.

They had families to support 
I do not think words will shape our future  the world as a whole. We are destroying our planet and destroying our natural resources. I believe Earth will deal with consequences of abusing the planet and my grandchildren will suffer for our neglect and greed.

<response>It means the right to express and receive unique views of politics, lifestyle and information without a thumb on the scale. A group or government which controls people or information to manipulate reality or obfuscate truth is antithetical freedom. My view recently have been much more focused on the bias of media and the way money controls information. 
I had an experience when I was younger where I was struck at an intersection by a vehicle who ran a red light. There was witness testimony taken on the scene that verified a very expensive car ran a red light and struck my car. 
When I received the police report, it stated that there was no fault from either driver. No witness statements, photos or description. I felt it was likely the driver of the sports car, whom I later found out was in the city as a sponsor of a large golf tournament,  had likely paid off the officer to remove fault and liability. I lost transportation and was financially burdened by someone who used their wealth to take my freedom.</response>

<question>Considering your experience, how might the idea of fairness connect with your understanding of freedom, especially when power or money seems to influence what is true?</question>

<response>Equality is everyone playing on equal grounds. The outcome of a race doesn't hinge on the amount of media you can purchase or experts you can hire.
I came from a very poor household growing up. As such, it was necessary to take on substantial debt to continue education after primary school. The debt has followed me my entire life affecting housing, food, credit and opportunity.

<question>Thinking about playing on equal grounds, what might it look like for everyone to start the race of life from the same spot, no matter their family's money?</question>
<response>It changes how people are viewed and the stigma that follows them. Poverty is extremely stressful for children and adults. The behaviors you learn growing up in economic stress impacts you for the rest of your life.
Poor people treat money as temporary; use it or lose it. If you don't spend the money you earn quickly it will just end up going to bills, fees or cost of living. The wealthy use money as investment; the burden of living removed, you can plan on how to use your wealth to insure your future.</response>

<response>These phrases are challenging to many, as they are written without context of the time. ""Our nation was conceived in liberty"" was spoken by Abraham Lincoln in response to the challenge of slavery and division of the states. But, the United States wasn't conceived with all men created equal; children were born in to slavery. 
It is easy for people to skew and manipulate others perception of the past when there is a financial incentive (slavery, debt) to propel inequality. 
All men created equal needs to come with actual consequence. Until wealth and power are divided from justice there is no equality.</response>

I can choose where I want to live, what type of education I want, the type of job field I want to be in, who I want to vote for, if I want to go to church and many other things.  Many things in life have led me to those conclusions.  For example, I have a job based on experience, but I know that if I wanted to go back to school to choose another field, I can do so.

1989,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me, is being able to express my thoughts and understanding about any situation without negative penalties.  Freedom also allows me to make use of my abilities in a positive manner without discriminatory bias. It also means being allowed to make decisions based on my personal conditions. I once was travelling within the United States for my birthday with my younger cousin. We had such a great time that we decided to travel slightly beyond the border of Mexico. We went and continued to enjoy the time for a few hours in Tijuana. As we were leaving, we got stopped at the border for about an hour while the Border Patrol checked our IDs and vehicle. After being allowed to continue on our journey and riding into the sunrise, I could just remember the great time of being free and allowed to travel and experience life on my Twenty First birthday.</response>

<question>Considering your experience at the border, how did that brief stop make you feel about your freedom to travel, and what did it teach you about the limits or protections of that freedom?</question>
<response>The stop at the border was slightly uncomfortable, but knowing I was on a peaceful, fun, and learning experience, I had confidence that the border patrol was doing their job to ensure safety. I also learned that no matter where you travel, there will always be rules and guidelines that have to be followed. The border patrol was kind but assertive, and was curious about what was being brought back to the United States. It was at that point when I realized how agriculture and many other items were checked for quality assurance, and certain regulations were set in place</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means not being discriminated against or judged for the way you were born, or for ideas that do not follow a particular pattern.  I grew up in a poverty-stricken city, where many Jobs had an equal opportunity guideline. This led me to think that many of my neighbors had less chance of being successful in the job market and not being able to progress. Not because of skill or ability, but because of some sort of discrimination or in equality.</response>

<question>When you saw some neighbors face discrimination, what did you observe that made you feel it was not about their skills, but something else?</question>
<response>I noticed growing up that there were many trade skills utilized. There were far fewer corporate jobs available to my neighbors so therefore they had to use their personal skills to pay the bills. I also noticed that when i was noticed that i spoke Spanish, I had a greater opportunity in many job placements. But it seemed that as a young man at the time with darker-colored skin, people were surprised and thought that I wasn't American.</response>

2890,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me means the freedom of expression, of speech, the freedom to live where you want (because I've heard that in other countries, at least in the past 50 years, people weren't allowed to move to a different province). Freedom is being able to walk down the street and not be harrassed because of how you look or what people perceive about you.

I am Mexican-American and Indigenous so I come to these ideas for what I sometimes wish were true. I mean, I've been harrassed for my skin color and my family is *from* America! (ha!) But, though America has its flaws, I'd not live anywhere else.</response>

<question>Considering your experiences as Mexican-American and Indigenous, what makes America, despite its flaws and the harassment you've faced, feel like the only place you'd want to live?</question>
<response>I've lived in England and the racism is far worse there. It's sneaky and underhanded. Of course, this was many, many years ago so hopefully things have changed. It's just that my ethnicity always came up and that's how I can tell people are uncomfortable.

This is the only place I'd live my life out because I feel like I fit in. I'd love to visit and maybe live in France, for instance, for a while, but there's no place like home, as it has been said. My comfort, my people, our humor, our ways are all here. Though things are rocky politically right now, there are always ways to get what you need.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means having the same opportunies, being seen as an intelligent human being, being given basic respect. People like to complain about America, but really it's more fair than many other places.

Experience led me to this understanding. Though I've experienced inequality throughout my life, I've learned that overall, things even out. Like, how life is unfair, right? But it's unfair for EVERYONE, so in that sense, it's fair. </response>

<question>When thinking about how things ""even out"" and are ""unfair for everyone,"" what does that mean for how we can make things better for people?</question>
<response>Things can be made better for people if we try to understand where they're coming from, economically or racially. Things can be made better if we learn and practice empathy.  In that sense, that's how we can even out things and make things better. 

I think we're getting better at developing and using empathy and understanding. Inequality exists and suffering exists, but if we understand that everyone on some level is suffering - some very much more so than others - we can do all we can to help alleviate that suffering. I want to spend the last part of my life (I'm now 56), helping people and hopefully making a difference.</response>

<question>Many phrases have become part of our national heritage. These phrases typically identify ideals that we would like our nation to live up to. Please consider the following phrases:



All men and women are created equal.
We have been endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We should be judged by the content of our character, not by the color of our skin.
Our nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.



How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>Those ideals should be put into practice!! I believe in every one of those ideals, but I don't think that they're implemented successfully. We are told that all men are created equal, but we all know that some people think differently and use that against those whom they consider ""less than"". 

I love MLKs ""content of their character"" quote. It's true. Look, look deeper and you'll see beyond someone's skin color or features and it is by our character that we should be judged.

""We have been endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" I love this as words of the Framers, but again, as an Indigenous person, Native Americans were only given the right to vote in America in 1968, so though those are beautiful words, they're not really true. It's true for white men.

We need to practice these words. </response>

<question>Considering your insights about these ideals not always being put into practice, what steps might our nation take to better live up to these powerful words from the past?</question>
<response>We must say no to hate. No more. There are people in the country who only live to be defiant, to take the opposite, opposing views, to be jerks, if I may be so casual. And it's like a Pandora's Box, once we let the hate out, it's hard to get it under control. I think things like Fox News and certain ""influencers"" are a huge part of this Pandora's Box.

I agree with Michelle Obama's, ""When they go low, we go higher."" It's hard. It's HARD when there are people actively hating you, but that's one step. Another step is education. Teach empathy and teach actual history, like what happened to Native Americans and Mexicans and Blacks. Don't censor and whitewash our history! Yes, it's shocking to learn those things but they must be learned so that we can maybe heal as a nation and be the wonderful country I know we can be.</response>","Freedom is being able to walk down the street and not be harrassed because of how you look or what people perceive about you.

2917,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me means being able to do what you want when you want. Freedom is opportunity. Freedom in essence is no restrictions. Experiences that have let me to this understanding is traveling abroad to other countries and seeing that not everyone has freedom. I've visited countries where women do not have the same freedoms as I do. For example, in many eastern European countries women do not attend school and are expected to get married and have children. To me this is not freedom as they do not have a choice. In America women have the choice to either have children or not. </response>

<question>Thinking about your travels, how might a person in those Eastern European countries describe freedom differently than you, given their own experiences and choices?</question>
<response>I think a person in Eastern Europe might describe freedom differently in that they might see it as tied to financial wealth. I think a lot of the women in Eastern Europe might not think that they lack freedom since the status quo is to get married and have children. I think everyone thinks that is just part of life that everyone has to do. I think in Eastern Europe freedom might be tied to having money and being able to live and eat well. </response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality to me means the same or being treated the same and no favoritism. Experiences that have led to this understanding is going to school and everyone is given the same education and everyone has the opportunity to do what they want with the same tools given. </response>

<question>When everyone has the same tools, how might different personal strengths or challenges affect what people can build or do with them?</question>
<response>I think this question touches upon the difference between equality and equity. Equality is being treated the same no matter what, however, we are all not the same in that everyone has strengths and challenges. Some people are healthier and smarter than others. Some people have physical and mental challenges. I think the different strengths and challenges can provide an upper hand to some people with what they can or cannot build given the same tools. For example, if person A was put on an island with person B who has a physical disability and they were both given the same tools, it is more likely person A would fare better. </response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>These ideals should be used as a blueprint for shaping America's futures but can be expanded. I think the all men are created equal is not very true as some people are created with more opportunity or ability.  I do however believe that we all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Additionally, we should all be judged on our character and not the color of our skin. I believe these ideals will help create a better America that everyone can enjoy. </response>

<question>Thinking about how some people have more opportunity or ability, what might it mean for everyone to still have an equal chance at life, liberty, and happiness?</question>
<response>I think the fact that some people have more opportunity or ability just means that the playing field needs to be more level to give everyone the chance at life, liberty and happiness. For example, I think people that might not have opportunity or ability should be given help so that they can an equal chance at life, liberty and happiness.</response>","Equality to me means the same or being treated the same and no favoritism.

2193,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom, to me, means having the ability (even if not the means, for example, a car) to go anywhere in the USA I want.  I can worship how/who/when I wish.  I can live where I can afford.  I know I have access to potable/clean water, healthy foods, a safe place to live and sleep, access to an excellent education.  I have the freedom to vote and to vote for whoever I select.  I can read whatever book, listen to whatever music, a right to free speech, to marry who I want, have children and/or pets, to live without fear of a tank plowing down my street.  I am protected by police/sheriffs/have access to healthcare.  All of these freedoms come with following the laws of my jurisdiction.</response>

<question>Thinking about all the freedoms you mentioned, like going anywhere or choosing your own path, what might be some of the most important things that make these freedoms possible for everyone?</question>
<response>The tenets listed in the US Constitution and those who uphold the Constitution help provide us freedoms.  Living in a democracy allows us to vote on many issues that help us, as citizens, help define freedom.  As much as I hate war, those who have fought for our  country including heroes who lost their lives doing so, help make these freedoms possible for everyone.  Certain laws, such as ADA, help provide those with diagnosable conditions freedoms and access to many opportunities.  Lawmakers, with their hearts and souls in the right places, help.  Not taking our freedoms for granted helps, too.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means equal access, treatment, opportunities, freedoms/punishments.  I worked in the field of mental health as well as disability services for decades.  Those experiences were huge in helping me understand equality, even from a family stance (e.g., one child favored over another).  Opportunities and punishments (e.g., prison) need to be meted out based on the achievement or crime, not based on a person's religious background or races, as in events that helped create the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement.  Just because a person is famous, or rich or a star, does not give privilege to hurt/cheat/steal/abuse another.  Treating all people equal is such a fabulous ideal--treat others the same regardless of color, religious, sexuality as long as they are within the laws.</response>

<question>Thinking about your work in mental health and disability services, how did those experiences shape your view on what ""equal access"" truly looks like in everyday life?</question>
<response>I learned to see how much so many people take for granted.  I learned to see how ""unfair"" so many life situations are at no fault of my clients.  For example, a student who emancipated self from the parents as they ran a meth lab in the house and my student did not want to get caught in a raid or an explosion.  The student wanted access to education but did not have equal access until emancipated.  Kids who have parents who are homeless do not have equal access, or placed in foster care, or who are sexually abused by trusted adults (church leader, neighbor, step family members, a cousin, etc.)  Families who can afford exceptional care for a child with severe condition vs. those who cannot afford care.  Access to mental health is not equal, as is for medical care (think of rural and/or poor areas).  </response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>These are each such incredible powerful statements!  I would be scared to know the last time many Americans have read these or even if they have read them.  I am serious!  Are these taught at home or in schools anymore?  If Americans adhered to these values, think of how much violence would hopefully no longer exist, or hate, or killing or political unrest!?  For example, if everybody respected we are all created equal, would people kill over what political party one belongs to, what religion I practice, if I marry a man or a woman, if I am gay/hetero/transgender, black/white/brown, if I dress a certain way?  If I am walking down the street and 4 black guys are walking towards me, am I going to have the same reaction as if 4 white guys are walking towards me?  Our American would be a different America if we lived up to these ideals today.  And the ""pursuit of happiness"" is huge.  It was explained to me when I was really young that that does not  PROMISE happiness, but the ability to pursue it.  I am not ENTITILED to be happy but to work honestly towards those goals, dreams and ideals that I believe will help me be happy.</response>

<question>Thinking about these powerful ideals, what actions or changes could help more Americans truly live by these values today?</question>
<response>Fabulous question.  Rather than debating about whether or not the Bible/prayer/10 Commandments should be taught/displayed in schools, let's teach the VALUES behind them.  I truly blame parents for so much of what is going on today.  I'm all for SNAP/WIC but let's talk about helping to educate about community gardens so that people learn to share, care, respect and help.  I am well aware of the 2nd Amendment but how do all of these murders/shootings/killings keep happening by people with access to guns that were not kept to provide food (e.g., legal deer hunting season) or ""right to bear arms"".  Unification in this country could help rather than leadership that is so polarized by party.  Rich politicians --how can they understand or even GRASP food insecurity or having nowhere to sleep.  Hate and negativity from the top certainly goes against all of these ideals.  </response>","Equality means equal access, treatment, and opportunities...

2617,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me means the right to free will. Freedom allows people the right to free speech, right to believe in whatever religion a person chooses. Freedom allows people to step out of their house and do as they please without the the fear is getting in trouble. Freedom allows people to dress how they want and express themselves without the fear of persecution. The experiences in my life that led me to this understanding would have to be from learning history and looking at the world as it is today. If you look at the protest going on in our country, if this was happening in a different country everyone at the protest would be arrested. You see it quite frequently where the protests are met with violence.</response>

<question>What makes a country's response to protests, like those seen in our country, feel different or more free than how other countries might react?</question>
<response>Well in quite a few countries when the citizens go out to protest they are in turn met with Force or arrest by government and police. In many other countries they will arrest or use violence against those who start the protest and those who attack physically or verbally the police. In our country you see people face to face about 2 in apart with the police at the protest and they are screaming at them waving signs in their face sometimes even throwing rocks and the police do nothing but stand there and hold the line. America is one of the few countries where this is somewhat tolerated</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means that every person is equal, both in the eyes of law enforcement and other people. Equality means that all people regardless of gender religion or sexual preference all have equal opportunities in regards to all aspects of life. They all have equal opportunities for employment.  The experiences I had growing up and the way my parents raised me. I was taught at a very young age that I needed to accept everybody regardless of their skin color, weather they were a boy or girl and their sexual preference did not matter. I was taught that we were all the same and that I was to respect all people equally. </response>

<question>How might your parents' teachings connect to how you see the law treating everyone the same, and what does that mean for fairness in daily life?</question>
<response>My parents taught me to respect your elders, be honest and follow the law. When I was younger I thought that the law treated people equally but now that I'm older I see differently. Police do a lot of profiling when they pull people over in their vehicles or when they arrest people. The jail segregate people by race. I do feel like the LIE should be more fair towards all people. In daily life I think we as a community and strive for equality and fairness but unfortunately we fall short. I do feel that people are often judged by their background or race when they should be judged by their actions.</response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>In my opinion these were ideas that help shape the concept of america. However these are ideas that we are still trying to achieve many years later. America even had slaves. Today is much better than it used to be with women have much more rights and equality then before. All people have civil liberties and rights. People's sexual preference and gender identities are now widely accepted and there are even laws protecting these liberties.</response>

<question>Considering your thoughts on how far America has come, what specific changes or actions do you believe would help us get even closer to fully living up to these important ideals?</question>
<response>I believe there needs to be drastic changes to get America to live up to these ideas. For instance currently they are having all the ice protest and Mass deportations, you hear it on the news all the time about Federal ice agents using discrimination and making unwarranted arrest and even in some cases arresting people just were their skin color. Along with the ice deportations are mass protest and multiple large cities. It just goes to show how divided America is at the moment.

2925,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom is several things to me. There is the textbook definition which we all know. But freedom is also a state of mind. We don't have to worry about stating our opinion or working in a job that suits us best rather than one chosen for us. We have the freedom of our choices. Good or bad choices, we are allowed to make them and deal with the results.</response>

<question>Thinking about your choices, how do you know when you are truly free to make a choice, and when might something else be guiding your decision?</question>
<response>If I decide to have  scrambled eggs for breakfast, along with sourdough bread that I made and toasted and slathered with butter... THAT is my choice.  Driving on the highway, I am guided by rules and laws of the road, the state and the country in which I live. If I don't abide by them, I must face the consequences of my actions.</response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality means everyone having the same rights and privileges. For a time within MY life span, I was NOT equal to men. I could not get a credit card without my husband's permission or knowledge. I could not adopt a child without a husband. I could not  enter certain professions because, as a woman I would just be in that profession to ""find a husband"" and then leave, whereas a man would have to support a family. For example, in 1964, I wanted to apply to Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine to be a vet. I had worked with a vet as his tech and surgical tech so I knew the challenges. But I was told that as a woman, I needed to first get my PhD  and be first or second in my class, and then they would CONSIDER my application. And no out-of-state veterinary colleges would even look at a non-resident. Yet today, I use an all-woman veterinary practice. They told me that approximately 65 % of vet school graduates are women. Today, we are almost equal to men, although through my 50 years of working, the men all made more money than I, even doing the same job.</response>

<question>Thinking about your experiences, what might it feel like if everyone truly had the same chances in life, regardless of who they are or where they come from?</question>
<response>I think people would be more open and less fearful about change if the playing field was even. The Glass Ceiling would become past history and not such a competition.</response>

How should these ideals from America's past play a role in shaping America's future?</question>
<response>I agree with all of these statements, but through the years, it has become quite apparent that SOME people are more equal than others, at least in the view of The Powers That Be.  Women have to adjust their speech so as not to ""offend"" their male co-workers. If a man is assertive, the same activity by a woman would be called aggressive..

I would say I'm very active on social meeting. I see how hard other countries have it compared to us and I think we take that for granted. I haven't had to live through hard times (illness, government relations, personal relationships). </response>

<question>It is kind to think of others. Could you share more about how seeing other countries' struggles on social media helps you understand what it means to live in fear?</question>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Equality to me means having the ability to achieve your goals, given all the same respect & rights to do so regardless of skin color, ethnicity, identity, etc.

I think a controversial topic is college. A lot of people would agree that ""white"" people have the ability to go to college & people of color do not have that same choice. I think it all comes down to choice. I didn't live in a household that could pay for my college education. I decided to work multiple job, take on the debt, & pick a major that I know will secure me a job that will pay for the education itself one day.  People say those who come from bad neighborhoods & grew up terrible are not treated with the same resources. It all comes down to choice. If you want better for yourself, to gain respect of others, you will make that change for yourself. I think everyone has the capabilities to achieve their goals in the US, without things getting handed to them if they really wanted them</response>

<question>Thinking about your experiences and choices, what might make it harder for some people to make those same choices, even if they want to?</question>
<response>I do realize that financial burden can really affect if you can achieve your goals or not.  I don't think that affects equality though. Theres many colleges that are cost effective, many scholarships you can apply to. To be honest, sometimes I think its harder for the majority ""white"" that are middle/low class. We don't have the wide range of scholarships and opportunities that those of color do. </response>

I think the second statement should be held to the highest degree within the law. We shouldn't be scared to go outside, we shouldn't fear our government, we can seek fulfillment without living in fear. That would mean the government needs to uphold the law- you break the law- you pay the consequences. Lately, everyone seems to just get a tap on their hand because someone doesn't want to upset the other side. Stereotypes do exist, and unfortunately it pertains to certain groups. For example, if I see a clean- African American, business attire, normal- I may not look twice at them. But if I see an Afrian American- dressed like a bum, pants to the ground with a limp, i may considered crossing the road for the fear of my safety. I would say the same if it's a white person.

1715,"<question>What does freedom mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>Freedom to me means to be able to do what I want, when I want. I think there are also classifications of freedom. There is spiritual freedom, where you're not held back by your mind. There is financial freedom, where you have enough independence to be able to move about freely and not worry about money. There is physical freedom, where you are healthy and able and have no restrictions. 

What's led me to this are the ups and downs of working many jobs, pursuing goals and relationships, being knocked back, picking yourself up, always continuing forward - even if it's a baby step. It's about understanding people and yourself, and how we're all in this together.</response>

<question>You shared about different kinds of freedom. Could you tell us more about how these freedoms might be connected or how one kind of freedom might help you find another?</question>
<response>They're all connected. Again in the end it's about relationships - with romantic partners, co-workers, family, businesses you frequent, strangers - nameless strangers you meet online - now even AI as the tech emerges. You can start anywhere and pull the string at any point, and eventually they'll all connect with each other. </response>

<question>What does equality mean to you? What experiences in your life led you to this understanding?</question>
<response>It means fair treatment without bias.  I think it's a culmination of knowing history and studying it and seeing how events shaped our society. My experience is likely based on not always practicing equality and having equality not always practiced for me - and coming to an understanding on how to treat people and how I want to be treated, and making an impact by my actions - all while doing my best to influence others to also lean towards equality.</response>

<question>Could you share a time when you saw someone not treated fairly, or when you felt that way yourself? What did that moment teach you about how people should be treated? 
</question>
<response>Well - as a minority I definitely encountered a good amount of unfair treatment and some bullying growing up. I don't wear my ethnicity like other races, so you might not know my background - but you realize any directed hate or prejudice comes from family and upbringing and environment, and those beliefs and behaviors can be changed. I've also not treated people right in the past, have grown from my actions and learned from my mistakes, and it's made me a better person. </response>
