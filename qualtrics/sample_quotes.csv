"Barriers to Freedom and Equality","A key barrier to freedom and equality is divisive political leadership, polarization, and corruption, which erode trust and unity","Freedom to me means being able to live and do as I wish, within the law, without interference from governments. But we still have governments infringing on our freedoms. I think more citizens should speak up about these inequalities, starting with their local governments, but most people do not trust their politicians. All my life, in my circle of family and friends, I have constantly heard mistrust and complaints about politicians. They need to earn the people's trust again so we can start working together to solve our problems."
"Society's Role in Freedom and Equality","Society must provide an accessible and equitable education system to foster freedom and equality.","My understanding of freedom came from my early education, like learning the Constitution and its Amendments in history class, and my main understanding of equality comes from an HR course I took in college. However, one instance where someone is not given the same chance is in college education itself. I saw myself accepted to many of the same colleges as my classmates, but due to different financial situations, we were not given the same opportunities and school options. This honestly made me sad, because I do genuinely believe everyone should have the same playing field."
"Defining Equality","Equality is when all individuals are treated with the same dignity and respect, regardless of their identity.","Equality means everyone is treated the same. I've seen clients or coworkers treated differently because their views didn't line up with their bosses. My wife was recently fired by her last employer because she was disabled and requested ADA accommodations... It made it very clear how some people are treated differently. To live up to the ideal of equality, we need to rewrite the laws so that no one is immune to them and hold people accountable for their actions, no matter who they are."
"Defining Freedom","Freedom is the ability to act as one chooses, with the responsibility to respect laws and not harm others.","To me, freedom means feeling at ease and supported to be who you are and live how you want without fear of persecution. As a member of the LGBTQ community, my definition comes from understanding the impacts higher government agencies and religious organizations can have on how we're treated. When I saw someone say they wanted to eradicate trans people, it made me fearful and influenced the importance of allowing people to be who they are without fear."
"Defining Freedom","Freedom is the ability to make personal choices and live an autonomous life, free from the control of others.","Freedom means that I am able to express views that might not be considered politically correct. But at this time, 'freedom' means the freedom to keep your mouth shut. I have been personally affected by this type of situation [for expressing my views on illegal immigration]. It creates fear and intimidation to feel that you can't speak your mind on the job, at school, or even with a neighbor! We need to restore many freedoms that have been stripped off of conservative, patriotic Americans. It depends on who defines words like freedom... Whose freedom? Yours? Mine? That's the problem."
